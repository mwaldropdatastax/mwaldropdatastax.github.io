I created this blog for simple information sharing.  If you found this by accident, you are probably not going to be very interested.  If you got here through a link or a suggestion, you might find something interesting.

This site is put together with some simple tooling centered around github.  Between github, jekyll, and some simple glue between the pieces, it all is pretty simple and should make for an easy site to update and manage.
